Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.\n","\n","As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like `print()`, etc. but you can also create your own functions. These functions are called user-defined functions.\n","\n","### Defining a Function\n","\n","You can define functions to provide the required functionality. Here are simple rules to define a function in Python.\n","\n","* Function blocks begin with the keyword `def` followed by the function name and parentheses ( `( )` ).\n","* Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.\n","* The first statement of a function can be an optional statement - the documentation string of the function or docstring.\n","* The code block within every function starts with a colon (`:`) and is indented.\n","* The statement return `[expression]` exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.\n","\n","```\n","def function_name( parameters ):\n","   '''docstring'''\n","   statement(s)\n","```\n","\n","By default, parameters have a positional behavior and you need to inform them in the same order that they were defined.\n","\n","The first string after the function header is called the docstring and is short for documentation string. It is used to explain in brief, what a function does.\n","\n","Although optional, documentation is a good programming practice. Unless you can remember what you had for dinner last week, always document your code.\n","\n","In the above example, we have a docstring immediately below the function header. We generally use triple quotes so that docstring can extend up to multiple lines. This string is available to us as `__doc__` attribute of the function."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"6zdApKGqwYBL"},"source":["# Example of Function Creation\n","\n","def my_function(p, l):\n","    '''Function to calculate area of a square'''\n","    print(p * l)\n","\n","\n","def printme( str_input ):\n","   '''This prints a passed string into this function'''\n","   print(str_input)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3KWLAfsgwYBV"},"source":["### Calling a Function\n","\n","Defining a function only gives it a name, specifies the parameters that are to be included in the function and structures the blocks of code.
