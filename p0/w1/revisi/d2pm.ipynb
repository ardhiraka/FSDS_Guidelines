These are briefly described in the following sections.\n","\n","**Numeric Range Loop**\n","\n","The most basic for loop is a simple numeric range statement with start and end values. The exact format varies depending on the language but typically looks something like this:\n","\n","```py\n","for i = 1 to 10\n","    <loop body>\n","```\n","\n","Here, the body of the loop is executed ten times. The variable i assumes the value 1 on the first iteration, 2 on the second, and so on. This sort of for loop is used in the languages BASIC, Algol, and Pascal.\n","\n","**Three-Expression Loop**\n","\n","Another form of for loop popularized by the C programming language contains three parts:\n","\n","- An initialization\n","- An expression specifying an ending condition\n","- An action to be performed at the end of each iteration.\n","\n","This type of has the following form:\n","\n","```py\n","for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++)\n","    <loop body>\n","```\n","\n","This loop is interpreted as follows:\n","\n","- Initialize i to 1.\n","- Continue looping as long as i <= 10.\n","- Increment i by 1 after each loop iteration.\n","\n","Three-expression for loops are popular because the expressions specified for the three parts can be nearly anything, so this has quite a bit more flexibility than the simpler numeric range form shown above. These for loops are also featured in the C++, Java, PHP, and Perl languages.\n","\n","**Collection-Based or Iterator-Based Loop**\n","\n","This type of loop iterates over a collection of objects, rather than specifying numeric values or conditions:\n","\n","```py\n","for i in <collection>\n","    <loop body>\n","```\n","\n","Each time through the loop, the variable i takes on the value of the next object in `<collection>`.
