It’s the universal standard for working with numerical data in Python, and it’s at the core of the scientific Python and PyData ecosystems. NumPy users include everyone from beginning coders to experienced researchers doing state-of-the-art scientific and industrial research and development. \n","\n","The NumPy API is used extensively in Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, scikit-image and most other data science and scientific Python packages.\n","\n","The NumPy library contains multidimensional array and matrix data structures (you’ll find more information about this in later sections). It provides ndarray, a homogeneous n-dimensional array object, with methods to efficiently operate on it. NumPy can be used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays. It adds powerful data structures to Python that guarantee efficient calculations with arrays and matrices and it supplies an enormous library of high-level mathematical functions that operate on these arrays and matrices.\n","\n","**Installing NumPy**\n","\n","If you already have Python, you can install NumPy with:\n","\n","`conda install numpy`\n","\n","or\n","\n","`pip install numpy`\n","\n","**How to import NumPy**\n","\n","Any time you want to use a package or library in your code, you first need to make it accessible.\n","\n","In order to start using NumPy and all of the functions available in NumPy, you’ll need to import it. This can be easily done with this import statement:\n","\n","> **`import numpy as np`**\n","\n","(We shorten “numpy” to “np” in order to save time and also to keep code standardized so that anyone working with your code can easily understand and run it.)\n","\n","**Why use NumPy?**\n","\n","NumPy arrays are faster and more compact than Python lists. An array consumes less memory and is far more convenient to use. NumPy uses much less memory to store data and it provides a mechanism of specifying the data types, which allows the code to be optimized even further."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6z4efogjrqRU"},"source":["## Terminology\n","\n","**What is an array?**\n","\n","An array is a central data structure of the NumPy library. It’s a grid of values and it contains information about the raw data, how to locate an element, and how to interpret an element. It has a grid of elements that can be indexed in various ways. The elements are all of the same type, referred to as the array dtype (data type).\n","\n","An array can be indexed by a tuple of nonnegative integers, by booleans, by another array, or by integers. The rank of the array is the number of dimensions. The shape of the array is a tuple of integers giving the size of the array along each dimension.\n","\n","One way we can initialize NumPy arrays is from nested Python lists.\n","\n","`a = np.array([[1 , 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12]])`\n","\n","We can access the elements in the array using square brackets. When you’re accessing elements, remember that indexing in NumPy starts at 0. That means that if you want to access the first element in your array, you’ll be accessing element “0”.\n","\n","`print(a[0])`\n","\n","Output:\n","\n","`[1 2 3 4]`\n","\n","More information about arrays\n","\n","> 1D array, 2D array, ndarray, vector, matrix\n","\n","You might occasionally hear an array referred to as a “ndarray,” which is shorthand for “N-dimensional array.” An N-dimensional array is simply an array with any number of dimensions. You might also hear 1-D, or one-dimensional array, 2-D, or two-dimensional array, and so on. The NumPy ndarray class is used to represent both matrices and vectors. A vector is an array with a single column, while a matrix refers to an array with multiple columns.\n","\n","**What are the attributes of an array?**\n","\n","An array is usually a fixed-size container of items of the same type and size. The number of dimensions and items in an array is defined by its shape. The shape of an array is a tuple of non-negative integers that specify the sizes of each dimension.\n","\n","In NumPy, dimensions are called axes. This means that if you have a 2D array that looks like this:\n","\n","```py\n","[[0., 0., 0.],\n"," [1., 1., 1.]]\n","```\n","\n","Your array has 2 axes. The first axis has a length of 2 and the second axis has a length of 3.\n","\n","Just like in other Python container objects, the contents of an array can be accessed and modified by indexing or slicing the array. Different arrays can share the same data, so changes made on one array might be visible in another.\n","\n","Array attributes reflect information intrinsic to the array itself. If you need to get, or even set, properties of an array without creating a new array, you can often access an array through its attributes.\n","\n","**What’s the difference between a Python list and a NumPy array?**\n","\n","NumPy gives you an enormous range of fast and efficient numerically-related options. While a Python list can contain different data types within a single list, all of the elements in a NumPy array should be homogenous. The mathematical operations that are meant to be performed on arrays wouldn’t be possible if the arrays weren’t homogenous."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"T8Gm1DXorqRW"},"source":["## Array\n","\n","### Creating Array\n","\n","```py\n","np.array()\n","np.zeros()\n","np.ones()\n","np.empty()\n","np.arange()\n","```\n","\n","To create a NumPy array, you can use the function `np.array()`.\n","\n","All you need to do to create a simple array is pass a list to it.
