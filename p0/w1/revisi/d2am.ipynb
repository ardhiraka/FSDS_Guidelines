The name is an acronym for the ' Bourne-Again SHell ', a pun on Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct ancestor of the current Unix shell sh , which appeared in the Seventh Edition Bell Labs Research version of Unix.\n","\n","Summary of Basic Commands:\n","- `echo` is a command to write a text or string, example: `echo \"Hello hacktiv8\"` . If you want to add text to the file : `echo \"Hello, my name is sardi\" >> name.txt` .\n","- `pwd` is a command to find the path of the directory (folder) you are currently using.\n","- `cd` to call a directory or path.\n","example: `cd /home/username/sardi/hacktiv8` . If you want to move to the root directory, you can type the command: `cd ~`. If you want to go to the parent directory of hacktiv8 by typing: `cd ..` , then you will be in the path `/home/username/sardi/` .\n","- `ls` is the basic command used to view the contents of a directory.\n","- `cp` used to copy files from one directory to a different directory. Example: `cp /home/user/sardi/sardi.txt /home/user/sardi/hacktiv8` .\n","- `mv` is a command to move files and can also be used to change or rename files. Example : `mv sardi.txt /home/user/hacktiv8` .\n","If you want to rename the file, you can use the command: `mv sardi.txt sardi2.txt` .\n","- `mkdir` is the command that works to create a new directory. example: `mkdir name_directory`\n","- `rm` is the basic command to delete a directory and its contents. If you only want to delete the directory, you can use the command: `rmdir` atau `rm -r`.\n","- `cat` is used to read files or create new files. for example to read a file: `cat sardi.txt` . If you want to create a new file, you can use the command: `cat > newfile.txt` ,then write the text that will be filled and then press CTRL + C to close the command.\n","- `vim` is the command that works to create files and fill in text. for example, write `vim nama_file.txt` in the terminal then fill in the text then press the keyboard button `Esc` then type `:wq` to write and save changes then exit, `:q!` stop and destroy the changes made, `:q` exit if no changes. \n","- `grep` is a command to search all texts in a given file, example: `grep query namefile.txt` . the query here is the word or text that will be searched in `namefile.txt`. we can use `\"-i\"` to ignore case sensitive. Example : `grep -i 'hello hacktiv8' file.txt` ,then all `hello hacktiv8` words that use upper or lowercase letters will appear. If you want to add line numbers, use `\"-n\"` , example: `grep -n query file.txt` .\n","- `wget` is a command to download files from the internet. example: `wget https://wordpress.org/latest.zip` . If you want to save with a different name, use `\"-O\"`, example : `wget -O wordpressku.zip https://wordpress.org/latest.zip`. We can also use \"-P\" to save in another directory `wget -P documents/myDirectory/ https://wordpress.org/latest.zip` .\n","-`zip, unzip` to compress files to zip archive and unzip command to extract zip files to zip archive, for example we want to archive a folder named \"Documents\" in a zip file named \"doc.zip\", then we can run the command `zip -r doc.zip Documents`. \n","- `awk` is a scripting language used to manipulate data and generate records.\n"," - Using awk to print lines containing a specific word in a file: `awk '/irfan/ {print}' employee.txt` , every line that contains the word `irfan` to be printed. For more details, see the following picture:\n","  \n","    ![](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/hacktiv8/blob/master/awk1.png?raw=true)\n","\n"," - Splitting a Line Into Fields: For each record i.e. a line, the awk command divides the records delimited by a space character by default and stores them in a variable `$n`. If the line has 3 words, it will be stored in `$1`, `$2` dan `$3`. while, `$0` represents the whole line. Look at the following picture:\n","\n","    ![](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/hacktiv8/blob/master/awk2.png?raw=true)\n","\n"," - `NR` (Display Line Number) & `NF` (Display Last Field). Examples of NR and NF can be seen in the image below:\n","\n","    ![](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/hacktiv8/blob/master/awk3.png?raw=true)\n","\n","- `sed` is stands for stream editor and can perform many functions on files like search, replace, delete etc. the `sed` command is generally applied to replace the contents in a file. \n","  - Implementing `sed` to replace string: \n","\n","    ![](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/hacktiv8/blob/master/sed1.png?raw=true)\n","\n","  - Replacing the nth occurrence of a pattern in a line : Use the /1, /2 etc flags to replace the first, second occurrence of a pattern in a line.\n","\n","    ![](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/hacktiv8/blob/master/sed2.png?raw=true)\n","    ![](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/hacktiv8/blob/master/sed3.png?raw=true)\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"TVetAloTHNMS"},"source":["References:\n","- https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html\n","- https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"C7g_553v5QjQ"},"source":["## Github Basic"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3bU7JdMBFtHb"},"source":["\n","First, download git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)!
