    "“Data science” is just about as broad of a term as they come. It may be easiest to describe what it is by listing its more concrete components:\n",

    "\n",
    "- Included here: Pandas; NumPy; SciPy; a helping hand from Python’s Standard Library.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data visualization.** A pretty self-explanatory name. Taking data and turning it into something colorful.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Included here: Matplotlib; Seaborn; Plotly; others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classical machine learning**. Conceptually, we could define this as any supervised or unsupervised learning task that is not deep learning (see below). Scikit-learn is far-and-away the go-to tool for implementing classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction, while StatsModels is less actively developed but still has a number of useful features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Included here: Scikit-Learn, StatsModels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deep learning**. This is a subset of machine learning that is seeing a renaissance, and is commonly implemented with Keras, among other libraries. It has seen monumental improvements over the last ~5 years, such as AlexNet in 2012, which was the first design to incorporate consecutive convolutional layers.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Apache Spark; Apache Hadoop; HDFS; Dask; h5py/pytables.\n",
