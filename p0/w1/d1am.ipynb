Example: `cp /home/user/sardi/sardi.txt /home/user/sardi/hacktiv8` .\n","- `mv` is a command to move files and can also be used to change or rename files. Example : `mv sardi.txt /home/user/hacktiv8` .\n","If you want to rename the file, you can use the command: `mv sardi.txt sardi2.txt` .\n","- `mkdir` is the command that works to create a new directory. example: `mkdir name_directory`\n","- `rm` is the basic command to delete a directory and its contents. If you only want to delete the directory, you can use the command: `rmdir` atau `rm -r`.\n","- `cat` is used to read files or create new files. for example to read a file: `cat sardi.txt` . If you want to create a new file, you can use the command: `cat > newfile.txt` ,then write the text that will be filled and then press CTRL + C to close the command.\n","- `vim` is the command that works to create files and fill in text. for example, write `vim nama_file.txt` in the terminal then fill in the text then press the keyboard button `Esc` then type `:wq` to write and save changes then exit, `:q!` stop and destroy the changes made, `:q` exit if no changes. \n","- `grep` is a command to search all texts in a given file, example: `grep query namefile.txt` . the query here is the word or text that will be searched in `namefile.txt`. we can use `\"-i\"` to ignore case sensitive. Example : `grep -i 'hello hacktiv8' file.txt` ,then all `hello hacktiv8` words that use upper or lowercase letters will appear. If you want to add line numbers, use `\"-n\"` , example: `grep -n query file.txt` .\n","- `wget` is a command to download files from the internet. example: `wget https://wordpress.org/latest.zip` . If you want to save with a different name, use `\"-O\"`, example : `wget -O wordpressku.zip https://wordpress.org/latest.zip`. We can also use \"-P\" to save in another directory `wget -P documents/myDirectory/ https://wordpress.org/latest.zip` .\n","-`zip, unzip` to compress files to zip archive and unzip command to extract zip files to zip archive, for example we want to archive a folder named \"Documents\" in a zip file named \"doc.zip\", then we can run the command `zip -r doc.zip Documents`. \n","- `awk` is a scripting language used to manipulate data and generate records.\n"," - Using awk to print lines containing a specific word in a file: `awk '/irfan/ {print}' employee.txt` , every line that contains the word `irfan` to be printed.
