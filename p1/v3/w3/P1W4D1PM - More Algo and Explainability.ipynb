Why do you buy some items together? How likely do you purchase an item along with another one? Why sugar placed near tea bags? Is there any relationship between these items? What is the main idea behind it?\n","\n","## Market Basket Analysis\n","\n","**What Actually is Market Basket Analysis?**\n","\n","Market basket analysis is a data mining technique used by retailers to increase sales by better understanding customer purchasing patterns. It involves analyzing large data sets, such as purchase history, revealing product groupings, and products that are likely to be purchased together.\n","\n","**How does it actually work in real life?**\n","\n","Market Basket Analysis is one of the key techniques used by large retailers to uncover associations between items. It works by looking for combinations of items that occur together frequently in transactions. To put it another way, it allows retailers to identify relationships between the items that people buy.\n","\n","To make it easier to understand, think of Market Basket Analysis in terms of shopping at a supermarket. Market Basket Analysis takes data at the transaction level, which lists all items bought by a customer in a single purchase. The technique determines relationships of what products were purchased with which other product(s).\n","\n","![MBA](https://miro.medium.com/max/421/1*6uVTNwBuTTvpOpMhBPHghQ.jpeg)\n","\n","It works on the logic of frequent itemset as described in the above image. So, it seems like the person who purchased milk also purchases bread.\n","\n","**So how to find such Association Rules?**\n","\n","Association Rules are widely used to analyze retail basket or transaction data and are intended to identify strong rules discovered in transaction data using measures of interestingness, based on the concept of strong rules.\n","\n","- `Frequently Bought Together` → Association\n","- `Customers who bought this item also bought` → Recommendation\n","\n","These relationships are then used to build profiles containing If-Then rules of the items purchased. for example:\n","\n","`If {A} Then {B} : A => B`\n","\n","**Itemset**\n","\n","As everyone knows, an itemset is a set of items that consist of two or more items.\n","\n","![MBA-Additionals](https://miro.medium.com/max/166/1*GXQQsO2FuJbk8-Z70MUIxA.png)\n","\n","**Transactions**\n","\n","Transactions are the main data source of Affinity Analysis. Stores or retailers gather tremendous transaction data by recording activities over time. Each transaction is associated with a unique transaction ID (TID), and it contains subsets of itemsets.\n","\n","![MBA-Additionals](https://miro.medium.com/max/187/1*TSxr87-xhA6IHIKv5GXVzg.png)\n","\n","**Support**\n","\n","Support simply emphasizes how popular an itemset is. Support, despite being simple, is an important metric in the Affinity Analysis that used to determine the strength of association between items. Take 5 transactions, for instance. If you purchase bread in 3 transactions, you can tell the support of bread is equal to 3/5.\n","\n","![MBA-Additionals](https://miro.medium.com/max/192/1*QAfEmwoWOVCjAkiOMqBjeg.png)\n","\n","**Confidence**\n","\n","While the support emphasizes how popular an itemset is, confidence denotes the likelihood of certain items are purchased together. For instance, how likely butter is purchased when item bread is purchased. Confidence is typically notated as Bread ⇒ Butter (Proportion of transactions containing Bread that also contain Butter.)\n","\n","![MBA-Additionals](https://miro.medium.com/max/306/1*2TgF0JWLRWwtfefBt2Re0w.png)\n","\n","Confidence, as you can see above, is a probability and so its range is [0,1]. If the confidence of Bread ⇒ Butter is equal to 1, we can say every time a customer purchases bread, also purchases butter.\n","\n","**Lift**\n","\n","Like confidence, the lift is notated as Bread ⇒ Butter. It says how likely Butter is purchased when Bread is purchased while controlling for how popular Butter is.\n","\n","![MBA-Additionals](https://miro.medium.com/max/614/1*FRe0_HRlXqyg3rvs9Usb7Q.png)\n","\n","Lift’s range is [0, +∞]. When lift equal to one, bread and butter are independent and, thus, no inferences can be made about butter when the bread is purchased. However, when the lift is greater than 1, it means that the butter is likely to be purchased together with bread.\n","\n","**Conviction**\n","\n","Wikipedia says \"conviction can be interpreted as the ratio of the expected frequency that X occurs without Y (that is to say, the frequency that the rule makes an incorrect prediction) if X and Y were independent divided by the observed frequency of incorrect predictions.\" Conviction has the range [0,+∞] and the following form:\n","\n","![MBA-Additionals](https://miro.medium.com/max/462/1*88PnWvjVMoptWSsFR23LsA.png)\n","\n","Example of MBA:"],"metadata":{"id":"aMbJu9ojvEsB"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"Mg4jPvicuOXR","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1660053991710,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":13,"user":{"displayName":"Danu Purnomo","userId":"11502177151884456276"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["my_basket=[['bread','butter','wine','bananas','coffee','carrots'],\n","          ['tomatoes','onions','cheese','milk','potatoes'],\n","          ['beer','chips','asparagus','salsa','milk','apples'],\n","          ['olive oil','bread','butter','tomatoes','steak','carrots'],\n","          ['tomatoes','onions','chips','wine','ketchup','orange juice'],\n","          ['bread','butter','beer','chips','milk'],\n","          ['butter','tomatoes','carrots','coffee','sugar'],\n","          ['tomatoes','onions','cheese','milk','potatoes'],\n","          ['bread','butter','ketchup','coffee','chicken wings'],\n","          ['butter','beer','chips','asparagus','apples'],\n","          ['tomatoes','onion','beer','chips','milk','coffee']]"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def frequency_items (x,y):\n","    fx_=sum([x in i for i in my_basket])\n","    fy_=sum([y in i for i in my_basket])\n","    \n","    fxy_=sum([all(z in i for z in [x,y]) for i in my_basket])\n","    \n","    support=fxy_/len(my_basket)\n","\n","    confidence = support/(fx_/len(my_basket))\n","\n","    lift =confidence /(fy_/len(my_basket))\n","    \n","    if confidence ==1:\n","        conviction = 0\n","    else:\n","        conviction=(1-(fy_/len(my_basket)))/(1-confidence)\n","    \n","    print(\"Support = {}\".format(round(support,2)))\n","    print(\"Confidence = {}\".format(round(confidence,2)))\n","    print(\"Lift= {}\".format(round(lift,2)))\n","    print(\"Conviction={}\".format(round(conviction,2)))"],"metadata":{"id":"pommmqjVyjdl","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1660053991710,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"Danu Purnomo","userId":"11502177151884456276"}}},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["frequency_items('bread','butter')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"oJUGpBCVyx3g","outputId":"47c74220-a708-4fe4-fd30-4ee716151d37","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1660053991711,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"Danu Purnomo","userId":"11502177151884456276"}}},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Support = 0.36\n","Confidence = 1.0\n","Lift= 1.83\n","Conviction=0\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["36% of transactions contain both bread and butter.

Responsive to promotions.\n","- Potential loyalist: Recent customers with average frequency.\n","- Recent customers: Bought most recently, but not often.\n","- Promising: Recent shoppers, but haven’t spent much.\n","- Needs attention: Above average recency, frequency and monetary values.

Simple, a lot of these models are considered to be \"black boxes\", which means that there is no way to explain the outcome of a certain algorithm, at least in terms that we are able to understand.\n","\n","**AI Explainability frameworks**\n","\n","This is a subject that has been explored by many authors — in 2016 in a seminar work by Marco Ribeiro, Sameer Singh, and Carlos Guestrin a novel solution for the interpretability of a black-box model was proposed. The proposed solution aimed at building two types of trust: trusting the prediction delivered by the model and trusting the model.\n","\n","Since then many other frameworks and tools have been proposed to make AI explainability a reality across different data types and sectors.\n","\n","### SHAP\n","\n","In order to provide model transparency, the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was invented by Lundberg and Lee (2016).

This greatly increases its transparency. We can explain why a case receives its prediction and the contributions of the predictors. Traditional variable importance algorithms only show the results across the entire population but not on each individual case. The local interpretability enables us to pinpoint and contrast the impacts of the factors.\n","- Third, the SHAP values can be calculated for any tree-based model, while other methods use linear regression or logistic regression models as the surrogate models."],"metadata":{"id":"IG7D_EqmOECV"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from sklearn import datasets\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\n","np.random.seed(1)\n","\n","wine = datasets.load_wine()\n","wine_data = pd.DataFrame(data= np.c_[wine['data'], wine['target']],\n","                     columns= wine['feature_names'] + ['target'])\n","\n","X = wine_data.drop('target', axis=1)\n","y = wine_data['target']\n","\n","X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3)\n","\n","# Build the model with the random forest regression algorithm:\n","model = RandomForestRegressor(max_depth=6, random_state=0, n_estimators=10)\n","model.fit(X_train, y_train)"],"metadata":{"id":"ThzyViPPODSV","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1660053996929,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":22,"user":{"displayName":"Danu Purnomo","userId":"11502177151884456276"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install -q shap"],"metadata":{"id":"Y-quvSPFQM36","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1660053996929,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":22,"user":{"displayName":"Danu Purnomo","userId":"11502177151884456276"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The shap.summary_plot function with plot_type=\"bar\" let you produce the variable importance plot.
